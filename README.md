“Looking for Fermat’s Last Theorem Near Misses”

The program will read in two values entered by the interactive user (N & K) and
will search for near misses of the form (x,y,z,n,k) using Fermat's
formula. The program will print the results out on a seperate text file
called misses.txt. The user will be able to search through the file and
analyze the results.

To search for the near misses the program uses the formula: x^n + y^n <> z^n
