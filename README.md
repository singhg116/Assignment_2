“Looking for Fermat’s Last Theorem Near Misses”

The program will read in two values entered by the interactive user (N & K) and
will search for near misses of the form (x,y,z,n,k) using Fermat's
formula. The program will print the results out on a seperate text file
called misses.txt. The user will be able to search through the file and
analyze the results.

To search for the near misses the program uses the formula: x^n + y^n <> z^n

Instructions for the JAR file:

To run the main.jar file you will need to open up the terminal. Once the terminal is
opened up then you will need to go to the directory the main.jar file is saved in.

For example if you save the main.jar file to the desktop you will type in the terminal:

                          cd desktop (hit enter)

To run the main.jar file you will then type in the terminal:

                          java -jar main.jar (hit enter)
